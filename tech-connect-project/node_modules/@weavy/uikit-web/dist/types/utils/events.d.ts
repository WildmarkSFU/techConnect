/**
 * @class WeavyEvents
 * @classdesc
 * Event handling with event propagation and before and after phases.
 *
 * The event system provides event-chaining with a bubbling mechanism that propagates all the way from the emitting child trigger to the root instance.
 * @note
 * Each weavy instance has an event handler instance exposed as `weavy.events`. So references to `.triggerEvent()` in this documentation would translate to `weavy.events.triggerEvent()`.
 * For convenience the `.on()`, `.one()` and `.off()` functions are exposed directly on the weavy instance as `weavy.on()`, `weavy.one()` and `weavy.off()`.
 * They are also exposed as child object functions on spaces and apps as `space.on()` and `app.on()` etc.
 *
 * All events in the client have three phases; before, on and after. Each event phase is a prefix to the event name.
 * - The before:event-name is triggered in an early stage of the event cycle and is a good point to modify event data or cancel the event.
 * - The on:event-name is the normal trigger point for the event. It does not need to be prefixed when registering an event listener, you can simply use the event-name when you register a listener. This is the phase you normally use to register event listeners.
 * - The after:event-name is triggered when everything is processed. This is a good point to execute code that is dependent on that all other listers have been executed.
 *
 * In each phase, the event is propagated to objects in the hierarchy, much like bubbling in the DOM.
 * The event chain always contains at least the triggering object and the root, but may have more objects in between.
 * This means that the root will receive all events regardless of which child-object that was triggering event, but the child objects will only receive the events that they triggered themselves or any of their child objects triggered.
 * - The event chain starts at the root in the before: phase and works it's way towards the triggering child object. This gives all parent-listeners a chance to modify event data or cancel the event before it reaches the triggering child object.
 * - In the on: phase the event chain starts at the trigger and goes up to the weavy instance, like rings on the water.
 * - Finally, the after: phase goes back from the weavy instance and ends up at the triggering child-object at last.
 *
 * Cancelling an event by calling `event.stopPropagation()` will stop any propagation and cause all the following phases for the event to be cancelled.
